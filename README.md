Step 1:

Indexes compared:
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)
S& P 500 (GSPC)
Russell 2000 (RUT)
NASDAQ Composite (IXIC)
Chicago Board Operations Exchange VIX (VIX)

Quantitative analysis using: Closing prices, Returns, Histogram of returns, Risk v/s Return plot, Cumulative returns, Volatitlity, Value-at-risk and Expected Shortfall as measures to make a selection of the perfect index to invest in.

Selected DJI to invest in based on the various qualitative analysis measures.


Step 2:

Compared two stocks from each market sector as follows:
Large Market Cap : Apple v/s Microsoft
Medium Market Cap: Tapestry v/s Whirlpool Corporation
Low Market Cap:  California Resources Corp v/s Walker & Dunlop
Emerging stocks: Alibaba v/s Infosys

Used qualitative analysis of Closing prices, Returns, Histogram of returns, Risk v/s Return plot, Cumulative returns, Volatitlity, Value-at-risk and Expected Shortfall as measures to make a selection of the perfect stocks to invest in.

Selected Apple, Tapestry, California Resources Corp and Alibaba to invest in based on the above results.

Created a portfolio of these four stocks and checked their Value-at-risk, Expected Shortfall, Correlation and Returns. Thus, validating the portfolio.

Performed Efficient Frontier portfolio optimization to determine weightage to be given to each stock for investment.

Then I ran monte carlo simulation on this portfolio to predict the future three month trend.
